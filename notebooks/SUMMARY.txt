All notebooks validated:
✓ bigquery-exploration.ipynb - Valid JSON
✓ data-quality-workflow.ipynb - Valid JSON
✓ cost-optimization.ipynb - Valid JSON

All documentation complete:
✓ README.md
✓ QUICKSTART.md
✓ OVERVIEW.md
✓ requirements-notebooks.txt
✓ .gitignore

USAGE
-----

Quick Start:
1. pip install -r requirements-notebooks.txt
2. gcloud auth application-default login
3. jupyter lab
4. Open any notebook and run cells sequentially

Recommended Order:
1. Start with bigquery-exploration.ipynb (exploration)
2. Move to data-quality-workflow.ipynb (quality)
3. Use cost-optimization.ipynb (optimization)

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

To adapt for your data:
1. Change TABLE_ID in configuration cells
2. Adjust quality thresholds in THRESHOLDS dict
3. Modify queries to match your schema
4. Add custom quality checks
5. Extend visualizations

PUBLIC DATASETS USED
-------------------

Default examples use:
- bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions
- bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers
- bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current

These are free to query and work immediately without setup.

NEXT STEPS
----------

For users:
1. Follow QUICKSTART.md to get started
2. Explore bigquery-exploration.ipynb first
3. Customize for your specific use cases
4. Create automated workflows

For developers:
1. Use notebooks as templates for new analyses
2. Extract reusable functions
3. Convert to production scripts
4. Integrate with data pipelines

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

- cost-optimization.ipynb is simplified (can be expanded)
- Lineage analysis requires views/materialized views
- Some utilities require tables to exist
- Public datasets have query limits

For full notebook content, the data-quality-workflow.ipynb
and bigquery-exploration.ipynb serve as comprehensive templates.
